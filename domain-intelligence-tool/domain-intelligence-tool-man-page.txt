NAME
       inforensics-domain-intelligence - Comprehensive domain intelligence gathering tool

SYNOPSIS
       inforensics-domain-intelligence [OPTIONS] DOMAIN

DESCRIPTION
       inforensics-domain-intelligence is a Python script that performs comprehensive
       intelligence gathering on a specified domain. It collects and analyzes
       various aspects of domain information, including DNS records, SSL/TLS
       configuration, WHOIS data, and more.

OPTIONS
       DOMAIN
              The target domain to analyze.

       --json
              Output the results in JSON format.

       --markdown
              Output the results in Markdown format.

       --config FILE
              Specify a custom configuration file (default: config.json).

FEATURES
       The tool performs the following checks and analyses:

       • DNS record retrieval (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, SOA, SRV)
       • SSL/TLS certificate analysis
       • WHOIS information retrieval
       • Web technology detection
       • Subdomain enumeration
       • SSL/TLS vulnerability checks
       • HTTP header analysis
       • Email security configuration (DMARC, SPF)
       • CAA and TLSA record checks
       • Reverse DNS lookups
       • Domain age calculation
       • SSL certificate chain analysis
       • Security header checks
       • Web server version detection
       • DNSSEC implementation check
       • IP geolocation
       • SSL/TLS protocol support check
       • Domain reputation check (against common blacklists)
       • Robots.txt and sitemap.xml retrieval
       • DNS propagation check
       • HSTS preload status check
       • Generation of common domain variations
       • DNS zone transfer attempt

CONFIGURATION
       The tool uses a configuration file (default: config.json) to set various
       options, including API keys and output paths. The configuration file
       should be in JSON format.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Success
       1      Various errors (e.g., network issues, missing dependencies)

FILES
       config.json
              Default configuration file.

       GeoLite2-City.mmdb
              Required for IP geolocation. Path specified in config.json.

NOTES
       This tool performs active reconnaissance on the specified domain. Ensure
       you have permission to scan the target domain before use.

       Some features (like subdomain enumeration) may be intrusive and should
       be used with caution.
